# Homework 2 - Data Manipulation

**Due:** Monday, February 12, 2024 by 3pm

Read the entire assignment before starting.

## Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to practice Arquero and D3 data manipulation.

### Report

You will be using JavaScript and Vega-Lite in an Observable notebook for this assignment.  In addition to writing code to answer the questions that are asked, you *must also include an explanation of your code*.  This will serve as your HW report.

Remember that every report must have an appropriate heading (with HW name, your name, semester, due date, etc.), appropriate section headings, a References section, and an Appendix section.

### Datasets

Use dataset(s) of your choosing. This could be the same as you used in HW1 or a different one.

*Your final project will be to create an interactive dashboard using dataset(s) of your choosing. Use this assignment as an opportunity to start investigating some interesting datasets.*

### Questions/Tasks

*The questions/tasks do not each need to be completed in a single Observable cell.*

First, briefly describe the dataset you've chosen. Discuss the most important attributes and their datatypes.

**Q1.** Similar to **Q2** from our [D3 Data Intro exercises](https://observablehq.com/@oducs-vis/d3-data-intro), write a function to sort your dataset based on some criteria. This sort function must use the JavaScript arrow notation. Explain in words what you intend your sort function to do.  Demonstrate that this sort function works as intended.

**Q2.** In a single statement, import your data into an Arquero data table and display the first 10 rows.  Then in a separate statement, display the last 10 rows (without sorting the data).

**Q3.** Use Arquero to filter your dataset by some criteria. Explain in words what you intend your filter statement to do.

**Q4.** Use Arquero to pull the values from one of your attributes into an array.

**Q5.** Demonstrate the use of Arquero's `groupby()` and `rollup()` functions on your dataset. Explain in words what your operations are trying to show (or what question you're trying to answer).

**Q6.** *This question requires a dataset that contains a date attribute.* Take at least three non-nominal (i.e., non-categorical) attributes in your dataset and use D3 functions (`d3.min`, `d3.max`, or `d3.extent`) to determine the range of values (i.e., min and max) in each of those attributes. One these attributes must be a date.

**Q7.** Use Arquero to create a derived attribute on your data. The function to compute the derived attribute should use at least one of Arquero's `op`
 operators. Explain in words what the derived attribute represents.

**Q8.** Find or create a second dataset that shares a key with your dataset. Demonstrate the use of Arquero's `join()` (or filtered join with `semijoin()` or `antijoin()`). Explain in words how you have combined the two datasets.

**Q9.** Use Vega-Lite to create a chart from the resulting dataset from **Q5** (groupby/rollup), **Q7** (derived attribute), or **Q8** (joined data). The type of chart is up to you. Use appropriate axis labels, title, and tooltips. Explain your chart and how your data is mapped to the marks and channels.

**Q10.** Assume you'll be creating a horizontal bar chart with the values from a categorial attribute and one of your quantitative attributes. Create the D3 linear and band scales needed for the bar chart (do not hard-code the data ranges). Assume the chart dimensions (range) will be 500 (width) x 200 (height). Use `visualizeTicks()` to visualize the scales (you must include `import {visualizeTicks} from "@d3/continuous-scales"` to import the function).  *You do not need to actually create the bar chart, just visualize the scales.*

## Evaluation Criteria

Your assignment will be evaluated on the following criteria:

* Was the data thoughtfully chosen?
* How well do the answers demonstrate an understanding of the Arquero and D3 functions?
* Does the report contain the required elements?
  * Attention to detail, including spelling, and overall aesthetics will be a factor.
